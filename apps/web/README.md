This directory contains the main Next.js frontend and API application for the NextWiki project.

For a complete overview of the project structure, features, and setup instructions, please refer to the [root README.md](../../README.md).

## Getting Started

To run the development server for this specific application:

```bash
pnpm run dev:web
```

This command should typically be run from the **root directory** of the monorepo.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
