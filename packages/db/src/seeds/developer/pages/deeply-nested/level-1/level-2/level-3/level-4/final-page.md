# Deeply Nested Page

This page exists within a deeply nested folder structure:

`deeply-nested > level-1 > level-2 > level-3`

This demonstrates NextWiki's ability to handle complex page hierarchies.

You should be able to see the parent folders in the navigation breadcrumbs or sidebar tree view (depending on the UI implementation).

Linking to other pages still works:

- [Go to Getting Started](/getting-started)
- [Go to Markdown Examples](/features/markdown-examples)
