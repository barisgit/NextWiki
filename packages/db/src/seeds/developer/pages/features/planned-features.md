# Planned Features for NextWiki

NextWiki is an actively developed project. Here are some of the features planned for future releases:

-   [ ] **Centralized settings**: Manage your wiki from a central settings page, with configuration stored in the database.
-   [ ] **S3 Asset Storage**: Option to store uploaded assets (images, files) in cloud storage like AWS S3.
-   [ ] **Better Tags & Categories**: Enhanced content organization through tagging and categorization.
-   [ ] **Version History**: Robust tracking of page changes with the ability to easily revert to previous versions.
-   [ ] **Real-time Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to edit the same page simultaneously (similar to Google Docs).
-   [ ] **Typo tolerance**: Improved fuzzy search with better typo tolerance.
-   [ ] **Image/Video Optimization**: Automatically optimize images and videos for web performance.
-   [ ] **Install as PWA**: Add a manifest and register the app as a PWA.
-   [ ] **tRPC API SDK**: Generate a tRPC API SDK package to use typesafe API calls anywhere.
